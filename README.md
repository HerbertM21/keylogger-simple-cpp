# keylogger-simple-cpp

> Extremely simple spyware made for educational purposes.

> [!] I am not responsible for the use of the tool.

**Usage**: When the spyware is launched, the tool will act in the background of the operating system in order to record keystrokes in whatever program is being used.

If you want to try it in a ``windows`` environment, don't forget to end the ``keylogger.exe`` task in task manager.

Its use is simply for educational purposes, ``the code in this repository is incomplete for connecting the victim to the attacking machine.``
